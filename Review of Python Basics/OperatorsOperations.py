## Arithematic - Two types unary and binary

# unary

x = +3  # + represents +ve
y = -3  # - represents -ve

# binary

x = 4+7
y = 3-7
z = 3*7
a = 3/7
b = 10//3
c = 3**3
d = 50%10

## Assignment - = represent assignment from right hand side to the left hand side

x = 5
x += 10
x -= 5
x *= 10
x /= 5
x %= 5
x //= 5
x **= 2

## Relational and Comparison - Compare the operands present on either side

x == y
x != y
x < y
x > y
x <= y
x >= y

## Logical - Combine coditional statements and return in boolean values

not(x>y)
(x>3 and y<3)
(x>3 and y<3)

## Memebereship - Check wether particaular character exist in string or not

x = 'Krish'
'k' in x
'y' not in x

## Identity - Compare to check if both the operads are same objects

p = 100
q = p 
z = 100

p is q
p is not z
