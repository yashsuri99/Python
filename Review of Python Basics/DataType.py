# These are the data types in python

# Integers - Data type used to store whole number i.e decimal digits without a fraction part. Can be +ve or -ve. Can be hexa or octal

w = 10
x = 0xA0F
y = 0o37


# Boolean - bool data type can be true or false. 1 is true and 0 is false

x = True
y = False

# Float - Float signify real number with fraction parts as well. In this e signifies 10th power

x = 3.8e2
y = 10.6473

# Complex - They are pair of real and imaginary numbers. 'a+bj' where a is the real number and b is complex part

x = 3j -2

# None - Special data type for unidentified value. Signifies the absence of value in a situation.

x = None

# Sequence - Oreder collection of items, indexed by integers. 3 types are Strings, List, Tuples

# Sets - Unordered collection of values of any type with no duplicate array. Depicted in {}

# Mappings - Ordered and mutable. Dictonary represent key-value pairs. Key is immutable value is mutable
